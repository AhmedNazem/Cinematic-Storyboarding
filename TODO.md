- `[~]` In Progress
- `[x]` Done

## PHASE 1 — API Hardening (Backend Completions)

### 1.1 Middleware & Request Pipeline

- [x] `helmet` + `cors` + `rateLimit` + `errorHandler` middleware
- [x] Zod validation middleware
- [x] JWT `authenticate` middleware
- [x] RBAC `authorize` middleware
- [x] Structured JSON logger (`logger.ts`)
- [x] `correlationId` middleware
- [x] **Wire `correlationId` middleware into `index.ts` pipeline** ← missing from main stack
- [x] Upgrade rate limiting from IP-based → per-user for authenticated routes
- [x] Add per-socket emit rate limiting (Socket.IO flood protection)

### 1.2 Security Gaps

- [x] Add `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) header (strict mode + Three.js canvas nonce)
- [x] Add CSRF token validation for state-mutating requests
- [x] Add HSTS header (`Strict-Transport-Security: includeSubDomains`)
- [x] Validate request payload size per-route (not just global 10MB)
- [x] Admin routes: require MFA verification token in addition to JWT
- [x] Audit logging: record who changed what and when (append-only log table)
- [x] Fix TOTP security bug in `require-mfa.ts` — `verifySync` returns `{ valid: boolean }` not a boolean (any token previously passed)
- [x] CORS `CORS_ORIGIN` env var wired to actual frontend URL (was `*`)

### 1.3 Socket.IO — Real-Time Foundation

- [x] JWT verification on `connection` event — reject unauthenticated sockets
- [x] `/studio` namespace: room join with server-side project membership check
- [x] `/notifications` namespace: setup
- [x] `/collaboration` namespace: setup
- [x] Zod validation on every incoming socket event payload
- [x] Payload size limit per socket message
- [x] Redis adapter for horizontal scaling (presence state)
- [x] Optimistic UI reconciliation broadcast on conflict

### 1.4 Storage — Cloudflare R2

- [x] Configure `@aws-sdk/client-s3` with R2 endpoint (`https://<account_id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`)
- [x] Presigned URL generation endpoint (`POST /api/assets/presign`) using R2-compatible `getSignedUrl`
- [x] File type validation (magic bytes check, not extension)
- [x] Max size enforcement + virus scan hook stub (500 MB schema + `virus-scan.stub.ts` wired into presign flow)
- [x] R2 key naming: `/{org_id}/{project_id}/{asset_type}/{uuid}.{ext}`
- [x] R2 public bucket or custom domain signed URL generation for read access (no CloudFront)
- [x] GLTF sanitization: strip `extras` with untrusted scripts before serving (`GET /api/assets/gltf` proxies through `sanitizeGltf()`)

### 1.5 Observability

- [x] Integrate `logger` into all request handlers (currently defined but unused globally)
- [x] Sentry SDK setup (API side): source maps, PII scrubbing, performance tracing
- [x] Prometheus metrics: WebSocket connections, render times, 3D asset load times
- [x] Custom middleware to emit `api_request_duration_ms` histogram
- [x] `/metrics` endpoint (Prometheus scrape target, internal network only)

### 1.7 Auth — additonal Flows

- [x] MFA enrollment: `POST /auth/mfa/setup` — generate TOTP secret + QR code (otplib v13)
- [x] MFA enrollment: `POST /auth/mfa/enable` — verify TOTP and flip `mfaEnabled = true`
- [x] MFA enrollment: `DELETE /auth/mfa` — disable MFA with valid TOTP code
- [x] Forgot password: `POST /auth/forgot-password` — send reset email (anti-enumeration, always 200)
- [x] Reset password: `POST /auth/reset-password` — single-use token, 1-hour TTL, SHA-256 hash in DB
- [x] `PasswordResetToken` Prisma model with `usedAt` audit field and cascade delete
- [x] User invitation email on `POST /api/users` — fire-and-forget, failure does not block response
- [x] Schemas: `mfaTokenSchema`, `forgotPasswordSchema`, `resetPasswordSchema`

### 1.8 Email Service (Resend)

- [x] `email.client.ts` — lazy Resend instantiation (null when key missing, no crash on boot)
- [x] `email.service.ts` — `sendInvitationEmail` + `sendPasswordResetEmail` with graceful no-op when unconfigured
- [x] `RESEND_API_KEY` + `EMAIL_FROM` env vars documented in `.env`
- [x] Swagger docs updated with all new auth endpoints (forgot-password, reset-password, MFA setup/enable/disable)

### 1.9 Testing — API

- [x] Unit tests: services (mock repositories)
- [x] Unit tests: Zod schemas (valid + invalid inputs)
- [x] Integration tests: all CRUD endpoints (real DB, test org isolation)
- [x] Integration tests: RBAC enforcement (each role boundary)
- [x] Integration tests: soft-delete cascade (project → sequences → shots)
- [x] Integration tests: asset flow (presign, GLTF proxy) — mock R2, real DB
- [x] Test seed fixture factory (deterministic test data)

## PHASE 2 — Frontend Foundation (Next.js App Router)

### 2.1 Project Structure Setup

- [ ] Create route groups: `(auth)`, `(dashboard)`, `(studio)`
- [ ] Create `src/lib/api/` — BFF fetch utilities (typed wrappers around fetch)
- [ ] Create `src/lib/auth/` — server-only auth utilities
- [ ] Create `src/stores/` — Zustand stores scaffold

- [ ] Create `src/hooks/` — custom hooks scaffold
- [ ] Add `cn()` utility (`clsx` + `tailwind-merge`)
- [ ] Install and configure Shadcn/UI base components
- [ ] Add design tokens to `tailwind.config.ts` (no hardcoded colors)

### 2.2 BFF Proxy Routes (`/app/api/`)

- [ ] `POST /api/auth/login` — proxy to Express, return httpOnly cookie
- [ ] `POST /api/auth/logout` — clear session cookie

- [ ] `DELETE /api/projects/[id]` — proxy soft-delete
- [ ] `GET  /api/projects/[id]/sequences` — proxy sequences
- [ ] `GET  /api/sequences/[id]/shots` — proxy shots
- [ ] BFF never exposes Express URL to browser (server-side env var only)

### 2.3 Auth UI — `(auth)` Route Group

- [ ] Login page (`/login`) — email/password form + OAuth buttons
- [ ] Register page (`/register`) — org creation + first user setup
- [ ] OAuth callback handler (`/auth/callback`)
- [ ] NextAuth or Auth0 integration (PKCE flow)
- [ ] Short-lived JWT (15 min) + refresh token in `httpOnly` secure cookie
- [ ] `middleware.ts` — protect all non-public routes, redirect to `/login`

### 2.4 Dashboard — `(dashboard)` Route Group

- [ ] Projects list page (`/dashboard`) — SSR with ISR revalidation
- [ ] Project card component with aspect ratio preview
- [ ] Create project modal (name + aspect ratio selector)
- [ ] Organization settings page (`/settings/org`)
- [ ] Team members page (`/settings/team`) — invite, role management
- [ ] User profile page (`/settings/profile`)

---

## PHASE 3 — Studio Editor — `(studio)` Route Group

> All canvas components: `dynamic(() => import(...), { ssr: false })`

### 3.1 Studio Shell (SSR)

- [ ] Studio layout: toolbar + left panel + canvas area + right panel + timeline
- [ ] Shot strip (bottom): thumbnails for all shots in current sequence

- [ ] Keyframe markers on timeline track
- [ ] Camera path animation: GSAP MotionPath on Three.js `CatmullRomCurve3`
- [ ] `gsap.context()` cleanup in all React components

### 3.4 Shot Panel & Thumbnails

- [ ] Shot thumbnail generation: `gl.domElement.toDataURL()` → upload to R2
- [ ] Thumbnail caching: retrieve from R2/custom domain on load
- [ ] Shot panel component: thumbnail + name + duration display
- [ ] Drag-to-reorder shots (`orderIndex` update)

### 3.5 Undo / Redo

- [ ] Command pattern: every scene mutation is a reversible `Command` object
- [ ] `useUndoRedo.ts` hook with command stack
- [ ] Keyboard: Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z / Ctrl+Y

### 3.6 Zustand Stores

- [ ] `useStudioStore.ts` — active project, sequence, shot
- [ ] `useSceneStore.ts` — Three.js scene graph state (objects, cameras, lights)
- [ ] `useTimelineStore.ts` — GSAP keyframes, playhead position
- [ ] `useCollaborationStore.ts` — presence, peer cursors

---

## PHASE 4 — Real-Time Collaboration

- [ ] Socket.IO client setup in Next.js (`socket.io-client`)
- [ ] Connect to `/studio` namespace on scene open
- [ ] Yjs CRDT integration: shared scene document (`Y.Doc`)
- [ ] Awareness protocol: show peer cursors and selected objects
- [ ] Broadcast GSAP timeline `progress()` for preview sync
- [ ] Optimistic UI: apply local mutation immediately, reconcile on server ack
- [ ] Conflict resolution: last-write-wins for simple props; CRDT for concurrent edits
- [ ] Presence indicator: avatar stack showing who's in the scene

---

## PHASE 5 — Export Pipeline

- [ ] Server-side headless render endpoint (`POST /api/shots/:id/render`)

- [ ] Export status: SSE progress stream to client
- [ ] R2 upload of rendered output + signed download URL

---

## PHASE 6 — Infrastructure & DevOps

### 6.1 Docker

- [ ] Multi-stage `Dockerfile` for API (builder → runner, non-root user)
- [ ] Multi-stage `Dockerfile` for web (builder → runner)
- [ ] `docker-compose.yml` for local dev (API + web + Postgres + Redis)

### 6.2 CI/CD

- [ ] GitHub Actions: lint + type-check on PR
- [ ] GitHub Actions: run test suite on PR
- [ ] GitHub Actions: `npm audit` + Snyk/Dependabot scan
- [ ] GitHub Actions: build and push Docker images on merge to main
- [ ] Secrets via GitHub Secrets — never in env files committed to git

### 6.3 Kubernetes (Production)

- [ ] K8s Deployment manifests (API + web)
- [ ] HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) on CPU/memory
- [ ] PodDisruptionBudget for zero-downtime deploys
- [ ] K8s Secrets for all sensitive config
- [ ] Network policies: pods only communicate on declared ports
- [ ] `/health/live` and `/health/ready` endpoints (already implemented in API)

---

## PHASE 7 — Database & Migrations (Drizzle Migration)

> Note: Currently using Prisma. Persona spec calls for Drizzle ORM + Neon.
> Decision needed: stay on Prisma or migrate to Drizzle.

- [ ] **Decision**: Confirm ORM choice (Prisma vs Drizzle) — adjust tasks below
- [ ] If Drizzle: migrate schema from `prisma/schema.prisma` to Drizzle schema files
- [ ] If Drizzle: replace Prisma client calls with Drizzle queries across all repositories
- [ ] Add `?pgbouncer=true` connection string parameter (Neon built-in pooler)
- [ ] Enable Postgres RLS policies at DB level (currently only application-level)
- [ ] Composite indexes: `(org_id, createdAt DESC)` on all paginated tables ← verify in schema
- [ ] Add `(org_id, updatedAt DESC)` index for dashboard "recently modified" queries
- [ ] Drizzle-kit migration workflow for production deployments

---

## Backlog / Nice-to-Have

- [ ] Dark mode support (design token based)
- [ ] i18n (English + one other language as proof of concept)
- [ ] In-app notifications (SSE-based)
- [ ] Comment threads on shots
- [ ] Version history for scene data (append-only `scene_snapshots` table)
- [ ] Storyboard PDF export with custom branding
- [ ] Mobile-responsive dashboard (studio is desktop-only)
- [ ] Onboarding flow for new organizations
- [ ] Usage analytics (anonymous, privacy-respecting)
- [ ] Demo mode with read-only sample project

## Quick Reference — AXIOM File Size Law

> Hard limit: **150 lines per file**. Split at 120 lines (buffer).  
> Extract: types → `types.ts`, constants → `constants.ts`, hooks → `use{Name}.ts`, utils → `utils/{name}.ts`
